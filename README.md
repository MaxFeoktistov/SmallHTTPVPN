# Android VPN Client for Small HTTP Server  

  Copyright (C) 2024-2025 Maksim Feoktistov.  

  This project takes the Android VPN client example and adapts it for use with a Small HTTP Server HTTPS VPN.  

  The application allows you to set up an HTTPS connection to a specific URL. It will ask for a predefined VPN name and, upon acceptance, establish the VPN tunnel.
